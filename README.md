_"TCAW" (pronounced "ta-kaw"), is an abbreviation for:_

Tidings Come, Adventure Awaits
==============================


_Tidings Come, Adventure Awaits_ is a roleplaying campaign outline filled with adventures that can be autonomous "One Shots" or a long-running series leading the players into nearly any imaginable situation. 

TCAW is nothing more than ideas and guidelines that you may incorporate into your own stories, use "as is" for a quick game session, or link together to create your own "TCAW Campaign".



### Goals

* Provide an outline for stories, puzzles, narrative, and combat that will engage players and GMs alike.

* Stay rule system agnostic. There are no specific spells, monsters, well-known actors, or locations mentioned- only descriptions, themes, and/or suggestions to help you choose for your game.

* Suited for High Fantasy settings.

### Technical Notes

* All files are written using Markdown (file extension .md). While they can be opened and read in any text editor, any Markdown compiler should be able to generate HTML from best reading.

* All quests are located in: /src/quests.
