### Prologue

Just before entering the town, you notice a cold chill across your body. Of course you've felt cold air before, but this wasn't a simple sign of Winter or a cool evening ahead- it was sharper than that. Penetrating, even. You couldn't help but blink your eyes from the attack, even rubbing your arms and exposed skin to keep warm. But as soon as it stuck you, it ends- with nothing more but a curious confused expression across your face. Once you've re-established normaility, you realize that the sky is a bit greyer than it was just a moment ago- and that house on the yonder hill is posed direcly at at you. You're certain of it.

The town is small, perhaps a thousand people live in and around it. But even for this size, there aren't many established buildings of note. It seems to be mostly a farming economy, with perhaps some trading mixed in- but certainly not much. It's an everyday town, so-to-say- nothing out of ordinary- except maybe that house on the hill.

The main road ends directly at its gates, and these gates appear to fully surround the small hill that holds the aged home. It's not a home of incredible size- 2 stories, perhaps 7-8 rooms- but it's certainly larger than most buildings in town, though. The hill itself isn't massive either, maybe elevating the house 30 feet from the town's normal. There doesn't appear to be any attention to the estate, as overgrowth on the gates, hill, and house is evident. Even while not the most impressive site, it's certainly the standout in this town.

After taking it all in, you focus again on the local area and notice a small crowd outside a nearby building, perhaps aptly named "The Grey Above".


**TODO: What is crowd doing?**


### Manor Information

_[Information Difficulty: Easy]_  
The manor belongs to the Hurells' _(her-el)_- a well respected and wealthy family established many generations ago during the founding of the town. The Hurell family had always been a staple name in local government and important dealings, until recently. Recent Hurell generations have seen a remarkable decline in prosperity and hiers. A complete lack of social involvement for years has escalated rumors that there simply is noone left to carry the name. 


_[Information Difficulty: Medium]_  
The last Hurell reported to be seen was Enbar _(in-bar)_ Hurell, and that was well over a year ago. Enbar was the only surviving son of Hoff _(hof)_ Hurell, the last adult Hurell known to be alive. Hoff was wed to his cousin, Elyssa _(E-lie-sa)_, and fathered 9 children. Sadly, only Enbar survived birth, but not without tragedy as the trauma took Elyssa's life. 


_[Information Difficulty: Hard]_  
It's long been whispered that the Hurell's were cursed to slowly disappear from the world- and there's been ample evidence to suggest this is fact.
