Tidings Come, Adventure Awaits
==============================


Outline
-------

* Short adventures (1-3 sessions each)
* Players accept quests as they wish, there's no required order  (in most cases)
* Imagine "Indian Jones"
* Adventures don't _have_ to be connected, but there should be a common thread


Quest Concepts
--------------

* Spelunking into a deep chasm, at the bottom of which is an ancient great wrym. The wyrm is rumoured to have eaten vast riches of exotic gems its entire life, making it a valued target. What's not known is that the wyrm is long dead and rotted away, only bones remain. The rumours were untrue, as there are no gems to be found. Although, the bones are worth their weight in gold to the right people (alchemist, herbalist, etc...)

* (Requires Airship adventure) Airship travel to a floating island, home of an angry family of Sky Giants that hurl their feces at the lands below. The airship doesn't make it, forcing the players to find parachutes and skydive back down to land.

* A neighboring castle is under seige! The players must help command and defend the keep through tactical warface, seige weapons, establishing defenses, and perhaps even getting their own hands a little dirty.

* A recent haunting has the locals in an uproar. They've prepared pitches and shovels to take on whatever lies inside the old mansion, but you've heard that what's inside isn't exactly what meets the eye: A monsterous beast that would easily dispatch any of the locals. After a good scare and a spooky series of events, the party will unfold a child apprentice wizard having some fun! See: [Haunted House: 4 Tips To Terrify Your Players][1]

* The locals talk about a crazy old man living in the mountains, always experiementing with some new machine that can move without magic. Earlier today, some kids ran into the tavern claiming they saw him flying away in a buggy with huge bags attached to it's roof, but didn't make it high enough before he crashed into the side of a mountain.

* The fishing economy has tanked due to a fierce water monster attacking vessels outside of the harbor. The fishermen have pooled a reward for anyone who can elimate the threat and get them back to work.

* Gladiators are well rewarded to advance through a series of combat challenges while thousands watch. There is a stadium, there is an audience, there are combat challenges, rewards are waiting to be earned... but who will step up and become The Next Top Gladiator?

  Ideas: Flood for naval combat, beast fights, chain party together for combat, poisonous "first hit wins", mazes, stack objects to reach tall object

* A wealthy family is willing to reward anyone who can make their not-so-appealing daughter fall in love with a young man from a neighboring wealthly family. It's a "good match" for everyone, but the daughter hasn't caught the eyes of the gentlemen- yet!
